FEED BACK
Golang:
He has good experience in go-lang with 2 yr of experience including all topics of go.
data types, Concurrency, go routins, methods and functions, inheritance approach. Go commands
Coding feed back:
Yes logically also good and resolved the given problems using go-lang language.He has good technical skills also having front end scripting like node Js.
Unix feed back:
He can capable to work on unix operating system machines using linux commands and on linux scripting ha has knowledge and very less experience, over all he can handle the scripting.
Python scripting:
Not enough 30 minutes  time to cover all the topics including python scripting, So i didn't check the python scripting, So at least we required minimum 45 min.

He has 2 yr of experience as go-lang developer and he answered for all query's from go topics including logical programs, concurrency and micro services knowledge.
